I selected my PDF randomly from online. I wanted to work with a subject I needed to look up information on, so I searched, "Colorado Gardening". I was lucky that the first PDF had all of the elements I was looking for to practice on: headings, images, links, decorative images and a table. 

I created the accessible version of it through Adobe Acrobat's accessibility tool. I went through and tagged the reading order and assigned elements. Once, I had finished tagging everything, I ran my first test through the Adobe Acrobat's accessibility checker. It highlights errors and items I should manually check, so I went through and fixed the errors. For the next round of testing, I went through the and read the PDF myself, taking notes of the small adjustments needed and adjusting them afterwards.
